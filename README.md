# FPWM (Forked Position Weight Matrix)
FPWM builds  a graph model of multiple PWMs (or Seq-logos) to have a better representation of the different motif a TF uses when binding in complex with other transcription factors.
### Installation
Type the following in R console:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/rtmag/FPWM")
```

## Quick usage
#### MiniCofactor Report
This function helps in the exploration of binding partners in a cell line. Input the `mainTF`, `cell` line of interest and the `cobinding_threshold` to generate a PDF report of the binding partners.

```r
library("FPWM")
miniCofactorReport( TF = "CEBPB", cell = "K562", cobinding_threshold=.06)
```
<div align="center">
<a name="miniCofactorReport"/>
<img src="./inst/MM1_HSA_K562_CEBPB_cofactor_minireport.png" alt="miniCofactorReport" width="490" height="630" ></img>
</a>
</div>

#### FPWM creation and plot
Use the `createFPWM` function to extract the motif, from empirical datasets, that a TF uses when binding with a partner TF. `plotFPWM` helps in visualizing the FPWM.
```r
fpwm <- createFPWM(mainTF ="CEBPB",
                        partners = c("ATF4","ATF7","ATF3","JUND","FOS","CEBPD"),
                        cell = "K562", 
                        forkPosition = 5,
                        flipMatrix = FALSE)

plotFPWM(fpwm,pdfName="fpwm_plot.pdf")
```
<div align="center">
<a name="fpwm_plot"/>
<img src="./inst/fpwm_plot.png" alt="fpwm_plot" width="340" height="630" ></img>
</a>
</div>

#### Writing FPWM
Save the FPWM to a local file can be used in matrix scanning or matrix clustering in `transfact` format or `FPWMtransfact` format. `Transfact` format will have a matrix for each interacting partner in the FPWM, while `FPWMtransfact` will output a single matrix.
```r
write.FPWM(FPWM = fpwm, format = "transfac", fileName = "FPWM.transfact" )
write.FPWM(FPWM = fpwm, format = "FPWMtransfac", fileName = "FPWM.FPWMtransfac" )
```
